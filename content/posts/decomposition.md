In math, decomposition is a very powerful technique. Roughly means that given some object O, we have some collection {O_1, ..., On}, and some function F (which is not dependent on the spepcific object) such that O = F({O_i}). These O_i usually take the role of coefficients, meaning that we also have some associated basis for each coefficient.  
Example:

- SVD
- DFT
- DWT
