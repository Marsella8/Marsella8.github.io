1. Why do we treat multiplication and addition so differently. Isn;t one just repeating the other?
2. Why do Sylow groups matter? 
3. So ideals are the ring theory equivalent of normal subgroups:
    Subgroups <=> SUbring: they have to be closed wrt operator (add and mult, resp).
    Normal Subgroups <=> Ideals: on top of conditions above, we also need to be closed wrt to conjugacy (resp add, mult) wrt to all the elements outside of the group. Question? Why is the absorption 1condition imposed on mult rather
