2 opposing tendencies wrt raw materials:
- (#1) Harder to mine the more time passes (low hangin rfruites akk rich  or easy to mine mines becmoe less plentiful)
- (#2) The more we mine, the more sphisticated large scale stuff we can build to use those resources effieintly (or pivot to other things).

Analogously:
- (#1) The more people, teh more quickly we cosmuem resources
- (#2) the more people, the more smart people can work on making extraction more efficient

Can #2 outrun #1? Sure hope so !!

Also intersting too claculate the ROI on energy extraction (i.e. how many joules to pull out a joule ffrom the ghround):
- For oil, we are at: ... (1oo years ago, it was ...)
- For solar panels, we are at... 

If we go under 1 we are cooked!
