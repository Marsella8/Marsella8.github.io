2 way associativy autmatically gives n-way associativity!
Basically on a bin tree, if we can do the transformation:

    .
  /   \
 B     C [ADD SHCEMA OF ] => 

Then we can take any tree, keep the leaves fixed, and mess with the composition, while still mintaing equilvalence

You can reduce this to a canonicalization issue (i.e. from any parenthization, can we get to having it be, say, left associative)

(A((BC)D))
